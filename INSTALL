**           w3pw - a web based password console.             **
**                       Version 1.50                         **
****************************************************************

If you are updating from a previous version, please refer to the 
"UPGRADE" section of this document!

REQUIREMENTS:
=============
- A Webserver (w3pw was tested with Apache); for secure transfer, SSL 
  is strongly recommended.
  
- PHP (http://php.net) with MySQLi support enabled, and the MCrypt libraries.
  You can find the mcrypt libraries for linux installations here: 
  
    http://mcrypt.sourceforge.net/ 
  
  For a Windows installation, the required binaries can be downloaded 
  here:

    http://ftp.emini.dk/pub/php/win32/mcrypt/.
    
- A MySQL (http://myql.com) Database.

INSTALLATION
============
1. DOWNLOAD w3pw:

  Download the latest package from:
  
    http://sourceforge.com/projects/w3pw/files/
    
  Once you have downloaded the package, unpack the distribution 
  package:

    tar xzf w3pw-x.x.x.tgz

  Change to the directory w3pw-x.x.x

2. CREATE THE DATABASE 
  
  w3pw requires access to a mysql database in order to run 
  properly. Create a database called "w3pw" (or any other name 
  of your choosing): 

    mysql -u <your_mysql_user> -p -e "CREATE DATABASE w3pw"

  Import the database structure: 
  
    mysql -u <your_mysql_user> -p w3pw < ./backend/install.sql. 
  
  If you use another database name, change 'w3pw' to your chosen 
  database name. Also change the default password to one that you 
  would like to use, or see the step below. Do this prior to the 
  import shown above.
  
  Delete the install.sql file (for security reasons)

  Set your password for accessing w3pw:

    mysql -u <your_mysql_user> -p w3pw -e "UPDATE main set \
      pw=SHA1(\"<yourpassword>\")"
	
  The standard password that comes with the installation package 
	is "secret". Replace "w3pw" with your database name, if different.

3. SETUP THE CONFIG FILE
	
  w3pw comes with a config.default.php file in the frontend/lib
  directory. You must create a file named config.php. You may do so
  by making a copy of default.settings.php (or create an empty file called
  config.php in the same directory). For example, (from the installation
  directory) make a copy of the default.settings.php file with the command:

    cp frontend/lib/config.default.php frontend/lib/config.php  

  Once you have done this, edit your config file in order to change the 
  constants, DB_HOST, DB_USER, DB_PASS, DB_NAME, DB_PORT, TMP_PATH, and 
  BASE_DOMAIN to match your system values.
  
  BASE_DOMAIN must be set to the domain where you will be hosting your 
  installation of w3pw.
  
	Windows Users: Don't use a backslash in the TMP_PATH variable. 
  Instead use a forward slash "/".
  
	If you would like to set another timeout value, change the constant
	TIMEOUT also. 
  
  If you would like w3pw to generate a random password if you create 
  a new entry, change the constant RANDOM_PW_LENGTH to the desired 
  password length. If you want't do disable this feature, set this 
  constant to 0.

4. SETUP WEB FRONTEND
  
  Copy the contents of the "frontend" directory to your webserver 
  htdocs directory. Here is an example command:
  
    cp -r frontend/* /usr/local/httpd/htdocs
  
  This will change depending on how you want to setup your w3pw website.

UPGRADE
=======
IMPORTANT: If you want to upgrade from a version earlier than 1.40, 
please upgrade to that version first, then upgrade to 1.5.0.

DOUBLY IMPORTANT: Create a BACKUP of your current w3pw database!

Follow all of the steps described in the section above, but be sure to create 
a backup (see warning above) of your existing w3pw database. This will allow 
you to recover from a failed upgrade.

Point the database variables in your new config file to the database, as 
well as any other customization of the config.php file that you require.

Point your browser to: 

  http(s)://<your server>/_upgrade.php

and follow the update instructions. After a succcessful upgrade, delete the 
file "_update.php" from your w3pw directory.


USAGE
=====
Open your favorite webbrowser and access this URL: 

  https://<your server>/w3pw/index.php

(Alternatively, use "http://..." if you prefer to use an unsecure connection).

The forced logoff feature will not work without javascript enabled.
