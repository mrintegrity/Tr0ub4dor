****************************************************************

For an update of a previous version, please refer to the "UPDATE" Chapter 
of this Document!

REQUIREMENTS:
=============
- A Webserver (w3pw was tested with Apache); for secure transfer, SSL is 
  strongly recommended.
- PHP with Mysql support enabled and mcrypt libraries.
  You can find the mcrypt libraries here for linux installations: 
  http://mcrypt.sourceforge.net/. 
  For a Windows installation, the required binaries can be downloaded from 
  http://ftp.emini.dk/pub/php/win32/mcrypt/.
- A MySQL Database.

INSTALLATION
============

Unpack the distribution packet:
	tar xzf w3pw-1.50.tgz

change to the directory w3pw-1.50

create a database called "w3pw" (or any other name): 
	mysql -u <your_mysql_user> -p -e "CREATE DATABASE w3pw"

import the database structure: 
	mysql -u <your_mysql_user> -p w3pw < w3pw.sql. If you use another 
	database name change the 
	first w3pw to your choosen DB-Name.

delete the w3pw.sql file (for security reasons)

set your password for accessing w3pw:
	mysql -u <your_mysql_user> -p w3pw -e "UPDATE main set \
	pw=SHA1(\"<yourpassword>\")"
	Standard Password that comes with the installation package 
	is "secret".
	
edit the file include/config.php
	change the variables $dbuser, $database, $hostname, $dbpasswd, $port
	and $tmppath to match your system values. 
	Windows Users: Don't use a backslash in the $tmppath variable. Instead
	use a simple slash "/".
	If you would like to set another timeout value, change the variable
	$session_timeout also. If you would like w3pw to generate a random 
	password if you create a new entry, change the variable 
	$random_pw_length to the desired password length. If you want't do 
	disable this feature, set this variable to 0.
	
copy the directory w3pw-1.50 to your webserver htdocs directory
	cp -r w3pw-1.50 /usr/local/httpd/htdocs
  
  This will change depending on how you want to setup your w3pw website.

UPDATE
======

Follow all of the steps described in the section above, but be sure to create 
a NEW database and a NEW path. DO NOT OVERWRITE YOUR PREVIOUS INSTALLATION! 
Point the database variables in your new 1.50 installation to the new database!

Go to the new 1.50 directory in your webservers htdocs directory and rename the
file "_update.php" to "update.php".

Start the program in your webbrowser as described in the usage section below 
and follow the update instructions. After the succcessful import of your old 
database, delete the file "update.php" from your webservers directory.


USAGE
=====
Open your favorite webbrowser and access this URL: 

         https://<your server>/w3pw/starter.php (Alternatively, use "http://..." 

if you prefer an unsecure connection).

The forced logoff feature will not work without javascript enabled.
