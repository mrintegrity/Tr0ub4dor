Version History / Changes

Version 1.50 beta2
- Timeout event status is moved from the browser status bar to a 
  div at the top left of the browser window. This div is red to 
  call attention to the fact that a forced logout is imminent. 
  It also only shows up after a specified time (default is 30 
  seconds prior to forced logout). This value can be set in 
  the config file. The timeout status also has a link to reset 
  the timer to prevent the forced logout.
- Each page has been reworked to use more modular code.
- A common database class has been included for simpler db 
  connections.
- Output is XHTML 1.0 Transitional compliant.
- A new system message system has been implemented to make 
  various messages (such as incorrect login credentials) more 
  uniform.
- Added a text-link menu at the bottom of the page, included in 
  the new footer.
- Added helpful links on the "view", "edit", and "delete" pages 
  that link to the other associated pages for the current item.
- Various visual changes.
- Menus are now built from settings in the config file, including 
  the ability to specify which items should appear at the top or 
  bottom, or both.

Version 1.40
- password field is filled with randomly generated string when
